## Original datasets

Genetic associations of the sclerostin pQTLs with cardiovascular events and risk factors in the datasets in [@tbl-gwas-study-info] that were analysed by @zheng2023 (or equivalent[^1]).  

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Associations

```{r}
#| label: pqtls-assoc

assoc <- gwas %>%
  filter(flag == "Y" & !(id %in% c("GCST006979", "GCST006980"))) %>%
  select(id, pmid, trait, n, n_cases, rsid, pvalue) %>%
  arrange(pvalue)
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-pqtls-assoc
#| tbl-cap: GWAS associations with sclerostin pQTLs (original datasets)
#| echo: false

empty_kable()

assoc %>%
  reactable(
    searchable = TRUE,
    pagination = TRUE,
    bordered = TRUE,
    striped = TRUE,
    columns = list(
      id = colDef(name = "Dataset ID", minWidth = 100, align = "left"),
      pmid = colDef(name = "PubMed ID", minWidth = 80, align = "left"),

## Additional datasets

Genetic associations of the sclerostin pQTLs with cardiovascular events and risk factors in the additional recent GWAS datasets in [@tbl-gwas-study-info].
